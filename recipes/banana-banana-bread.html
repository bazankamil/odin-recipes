    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      "This was a very simple and quick recipe to make," according to LESLIE J.
      "I only added one teaspoon of vanilla extract just because I like the
      flavor of vanilla. It has a firm crust with a moist middle."
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 ⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

        Step 1
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
          9x5-inch loaf pan.
        </p>
      </li>

        Step 2
        <p>
          Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar
          and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until
          smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir
          banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter
          into the prepared loaf pan.
        </p>
      </li>

        Step 3
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
          comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10
          minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
